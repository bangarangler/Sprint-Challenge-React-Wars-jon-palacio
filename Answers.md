1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
a library that attempts to break up help you break down your code into components and pass state down from the top.  It will render a page through the virtual dom and only update certain components instead of reloading the whole page.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
to think from the top down, and to break code up into components that ideally do one thing and one thing well.  

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
class component manages state.
functional component may be faster but does not manage state. it can have state that is passed down as state but it is then a prop not state. also to get it back up the tree you have to use a callback function in the parent and pass it down as props. then use it to get that information back at the top.

1.  Describe state.
state is basically data.

1.  Describe props.
props to the best of my understanding is an abject of properties.
